<br/>

- I'm a developer who mostly works solo. My ambition is to create various projects based on my admiration and desire to improve or automate various systems created by me and other people.
  
- I've been specializing in LuaU for about 6-7 years now, so I can consider myself both a back-end and front-end developer. I'm also related to creating a graphical interfaces, its operations, and mini-react automations. My projects include a large number of interface libraries, created both for myself and for other people in order.

- In fact, my hobbies go into different areas. Whether it's animation, design, and so on. That's because I work alone and I'm always creating something on my own. I also don't mind working in a good team, but most of the time all my projects involved only one person.

- No, I don't ignore the purity of the code and the neatness of my work, as many do. I have always adhered to perfectionism and tried to become a better person in order to create high-quality work. Obviously, there is no ideal, but I always adhere to the good readability of my code, or the type of my visual work.

- I'm always glad to communicate with new people, whether it is correct criticism, or mutual help, or maybe just communication. My social networks are listed in the list below. If you want to ask me a question or ask for help, then write to me at any time, preferably immediately clarifying your goal, https://nohello.net/ is an example of this.
