- I'm a developer who mostly works solo. My ambitions is to create various projects based on my admiration and desire to improve or automate various systems created by me and other people.
  
- I've been specializing in LuaU for about 6-7 years now, so I can consider myself both a back-end and front-end developer. I'm also related to creating a graphical interfaces, its operations, and mini-react automations. My projects include a large number of interface libraries, created both for myself and for other people in order.

- In fact, my hobbies go into different areas. Whether it's animation, design, and so on. That's because I work alone and I'm always creating something on my own. I also don't mind working in a good team, but most of the time all my projects involved only one person.
