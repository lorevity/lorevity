`LuaU developer | Graphic designer`

I'm a **LuaU developer** known for projects like [visualise](https://discord.gg/) [discontinued], which had 35,000 members on the Discord server and [flow](https://discord.gg/flows) [side project], another similar hub with around 15,000 members. I've also worked on some other related projects, most of which I've worked on solo. I've been working on scripting for five years, mainly working on UI Libraries and hub projects. My goal is to focus on graphic design and the visualization aspect, striving for the highest quality and optimal stability to create exceptional projects in the future for users and myself.

My current project, which I'm working on, is called [*nullptr](https://discord.gg/swqnDC5WPC). It is mainly planned as an oneclick script for farming, and for some people, it's a method of earning money. This project is handled by a team, which means that its progress is faster than that of all my other projects, which is what makes it special and more profitable.
